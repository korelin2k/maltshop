![Da Burger!](/doc/daburger.jpg "Da Burger!")

### Where can I try it?
Try it out on Heroku now - [Da Burger](https://daburger-cove.herokuapp.com/).

### What items did I try outside of the assignment?
1. TypeScript - On this assignment, the sequelize part to learn and absorb was painful. Found some great documentation here:

[Michael Zalecki](https://michalzalecki.com/using-sequelize-with-typescript/).

Leveraged that as a good starting point.
2. Handlebars custom helper function
3. Used a template for the look and feel of the app / kudos to colorlib for the work they did on this free one!
